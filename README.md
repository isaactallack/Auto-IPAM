# Auto-IPAM
Auto-IPAM is a collection of Python scripts for programmatically adding blocks, networks, and hosts to Bluecat Address Manager (BAM), an IP address management solution. These tools automate the process of adding new resources to BAM, making it faster and more efficient to manage large networks.

Auto-IPAM interacts with the Bluecat BAM API. There are seperate classes for handling specific tasks, such as creating a new block, adding a network to an existing block, or assigning an IP address to a host.
